    "## Creating and Managing Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are at the heart of this course. Here's how to create and manage them:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a New Notebook\n",
    "1. Click on the **New** button in the top right corner.\n",
    "2. Select **Python 3** from the dropdown menu to create a new Python notebook.\n",
    "3. A new tab will open with an empty notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming and Saving a Notebook\n",
    "1. Click on **Untitled** at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "2. Enter a meaningful name, such as `My_First_Notebook.ipynb`, and click **Rename**.\n",
    "3. Your notebook is automatically saved every few seconds, but you can manually save it by clicking the disk icon or pressing `Ctrl + S`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical: Create Your First Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Python notebook and name it `My_First_Notebook.ipynb`.\n",
    "2. Write a simple Python code in a cell, like `print(\"Hello, JupyterHub!\")`.\n",
    "3. Run the cell by pressing `Shift + Enter`.\n",
    "4. Save the notebook and close the tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice will help you get comfortable with creating and running notebooks.\n"

    "### Practical: Use the Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal and type `pwd` to see your current directory.\n",
    "2. Use `ls` to list the files in your current directory.\n",
    "3. Create a new directory called `test_directory` using `mkdir`.\n",
    "4. Navigate into `test_directory` using `cd`.\n",

    "# Try it for yourself: Create and Save a Notebook or Text File\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Practice creating a Jupyter Notebook, performing basic operations, and saving your work for future use. This exercise will also prepare you for the next notebooks, where you'll learn to upload files to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a New Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "   - Name the notebook `Intro_Exercise.ipynb`.\n",
    "   - In the first cell, write a Python code that does the following:\n",
    "     - Prints \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "     - Calculates the sum of the first 10 positive integers.\n",
    "     - Creates a list of your favorite programming languages and prints them.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example code:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   \n",
    "   print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Sum of the first 10 positive integers\n",
    "   total_sum = sum(range(1, 11))\n",
    "   print(f\"The sum of the first 10 positive integers is: {total_sum}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # List of favorite programming languages\n",
    "   favorite_languages = [\"Python\", \"JavaScript\", \"R\"]\n",
    "   print(\"My favorite programming languages are:\", favorite_languages)\n",
    "    \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add Documentation**:\n",
    "   - In a Markdown cell, briefly explain what the notebook does.\n",
    "   - Use Markdown formatting to add a header, a list, and some bold or italic text.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example Markdown:\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Introduction Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "   This notebook is a simple exercise to practice basic Python operations and Markdown formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Tasks**:\n",
    "   - Print a welcome message.\n",
    "   - Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.\n",
    "   - List my favorite programming languages.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Save the Notebook**:\n",
    "   - Make sure your notebook is saved as `Intro_Exercise.ipynb`.\n",
    "   - Review your code and Markdown to ensure everything is correct.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Create a Simple Text File (Optional Advanced Task)**:\n",
    "- Open a terminal within JupyterHub.\n",
    "- Navigate to the directory where your notebook is saved.\n",
    "- Create a simple text file using the `echo` command:\n",
    " ```bash\n",
    " \n",
    " echo \"This is a simple text file created as part of the exercise.\" > exercise_note.txt\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ```\n",
    "- Verify the file was created using `ls` and view its contents using `cat`:\n",
    " ```bash\n",
    " cat exercise_note.txt\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prepare for the Next Step**:\n",
    "   - Keep your notebook and text file ready for the next part of the exercise, where you'll learn how to upload these files to GitHub.\n"
